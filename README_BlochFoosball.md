# 3D Bloch Sphere Visualizer + Quantum Foosball

An interactive **3D Bloch Sphere visualizer** built with **Three.js** and WebGL.  
It includes a **quantum foosball mini-game** where the player competes against an AI by aligning phase angles.

### Features
- Rotate/zoom Bloch sphere with mouse or touch controls.
- Visualize qubit state |ψ⟩ in spherical coordinates (θ, φ).
- Toggle entanglement with Bell states (Φ⁺, Φ⁻, Ψ⁺, Ψ⁻).
- Play an **interactive foosball game** at the equator of the Bloch sphere.

### Skills Demonstrated
- 3D graphics with Three.js and WebGL.
- Interactive UI design and real-time rendering.
- Quantum state representation and entanglement basics.

### Run Instructions
Open `3dQuantumSpheres.html` in a browser.  
Use sliders to adjust θ and φ, toggle entanglement, and start the foosball game.
